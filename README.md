# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Purpose of the analysis
The purpose of this exercise was to analyze the amazon reviews of jewlery products written by buyers that includes usual buyers as well as members of the Amazon vine program. 

## Results
1. There are 21 vine reviews and 7689 non vine reviews of jewlery products on the amazon website.
2. 11 out of the 21 vine reviews are 5-star reviews while 4444 out of the 7689 non vine-reviews are 5-stars. 
3. 52.38% of the vine reviews are 5-stars. 57.79% of the non vine jewlery reviews are 5-stars. 

## Summary
There doens't seem to be a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. We can conclude that by comparing vine member reviews with non vine member reviews. As noted above, the percentage of 5 star reviews is higher for non vine members than it is for vine members. That shows the vine members were honest in their reviews and not influenced by money paid to them. Moreover, in order to make our statement more accurate, we could filter the data out for verified purchases. That would make the reviews selected more pertinent to our research questions and hence will yield more accurate results.
